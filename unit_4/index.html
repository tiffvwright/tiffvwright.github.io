	<h3 id="header3">Welcome to Cocktails & Cockatiels!</h3>

	<p class="important">Enjoy a dazzling cocktail while watching the bird-iful plummage of our cockatiel birds. We offer a cozy and elegant cafe where customers can relax in avian company while enjoying food or drink. <br><br>

	Our cafe is a custom built parrot-dise for our cockatiels. There are lots of natural trees for them to climb and play as well as nooks and crannies to explore and snooze inside. For privacy, our birds also have access to a private aviary where they cannot be distrubed if they so wish. Our dedicated avian specialist will be on hand to make sure our birds and customers have the best possible experience. <br><br>

	We offer a delicious menu of teas, coffees, cocktails, paninis, salads, and soups, all prepared in a sanitary bird-free environment. Vegan and gluten free options also available. <br><br>

	We always recommend making a reservation to visit the cafe as spaces are limited. Without a booking, we cannot guarantee entry. All children who visit must be 12 years old and accompanied by an addult (1:1) at all times. Entry to the cafe starts at $10 per hour.</p>
